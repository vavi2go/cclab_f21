  <h2>Watchmen</h2>
  <p id="my-sentence">Watchmen is a 2009 American superhero film based on the 1986–1987 DC Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Directed by Zack Snyder, the film features an ensemble cast including Malin Åkerman, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Carla Gugino, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Patrick Wilson. A dark and dystopian deconstruction of the superhero genre, the film is set in an alternate history in the year 1985 at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, as a group of mostly retired American superheroes investigates the murder of one of their own before uncovering an elaborate and deadly conspiracy, while their moral limitations are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances.</p>
  <h3>Plot</h3>
  <p id="my-sentence">In an alternative United States, beginning in 1939 during the fading Interwar period, a team of costumed crime-fighters is formed – the "Minutemen". The 1960s Vietnam War era through the mid-1980s Cold War sees the rise of the "Watchmen",[9] team of heroes, whose existence dramatically affects world events. In 1959, after his apparent death in an Intrinsic Field Generator accident, Dr. Jon Osterman remakes his body as a god-like being dubbed "Doctor Manhattan." The U.S. government utilizes his powers to win the Vietnam War and gain a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union which, by 1985, threatens thermonuclear war. The Comedian is responsible for the assassination of John F. Kennedy. President Richard Nixon wins a third term, apparently after the repeal of the 22nd Amendment.</p>
